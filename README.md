Capstone Final Project: Encore README

Background: Encore is an app that allows users to keep track
of creative projects. It can be used for really anything butis angled at performances. Future updates will include the ability
to create shows that incorporate created projects for better
event management.

My approach was to use ember to have a user create a profile
that displays some basic performer information, can possibly
be searchable in future iterations, and displays projects
marked as public. Users can create projects, which track when
it is created, completed, whether it's public or private,,
and allows space currently for a to do list but again, future
plans include adding features for a more comprehensive and
versatile notebook.

Technologies Used: The back end API is done in rails, the front end uses the Ember JavaScript framework. Bootstrap and SCSS were also used. I also used ember-font-awesome icons, installed with "ember install font-awesome". 

User Stories:
* As a user, I want to manage performance ideas I have in a
simple, easy to use manner
* As a user, I want control over my public profile.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily sort through my
projects.

Challenges: I loved the process of working on this project.
I felt I learned a lot and where I had gaps in my knowledge,
I was very apt to look things up, confident that I could figure it out. And I often did. I am still learning but I enjoyed learning Ember and feeling more solid with Rails. I
am eager to work on this project some more: full stack is
no longer scary and I like using the back end now to do a lot
of the work for me I previously only felt ok doing on the
front end.
